# Python-PriceDrop
Gone are the days of manually checking discounts on your favourite items. 
Add a list of item links and the script will automatically scrape the website by using selenium to check if there is a price drop.
The script currently supports items from chemistwarehouse.com.au and woolworths.com.au 

### Dependencies
